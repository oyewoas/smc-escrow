**Escrow Using Smart Contracts**

### What's an Escrow? 🤔
An **escrow** is an agreement often used when transferring funds in exchange for a good or service. Funds can be held in escrow, and a third party is chosen to "arbitrate" or approve the transfer when the service or good is provided.

### Why Escrows Matter
There are many use cases for escrows across industries, including **real estate**, **charities**, and **marketplaces**. Escrows are the bread and butter of Ethereum Smart Contracts because they are:
- Easy to implement.  
- Highly versatile.  
- Extremely powerful. 🍞🧈 

### Who's Involved?  
We'll have three parties involved in the Escrow:  
- 🙂 **Depositor**: The payer of the Escrow, makes the initial deposit that will eventually go to the beneficiary.  
- 👨‍🔧 **Beneficiary**: The receiver of the funds. They will provide some service or good to the depositor before the funds are transferred by the arbiter.  
- 👩‍⚖️ **Arbiter**: The approver of the transaction. They alone can move the funds when the goods/services have been provided.
